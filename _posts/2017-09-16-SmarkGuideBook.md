##<b>Guide Book</b>

this file will guide how to use <u>Smark</u>.

-----------
###1 Just Easy MD Functions

We need easy functions just like <b>blod</b>, <i>Italic</i> and <u>Under Line</u>. It's enough for most of the edit needs.

Then we ask for some <b><big>Bigger</big></b> or <b><small>Smaller</small></b> size.
 
After that, as a programmer, I'd like to show some codes, follows as this way:

`printf("Hellow, world! ") `

and quote other's words like this way:

<q>The wind is howling. It fills you with detemination.</q>

We need some mathmatic expression, So it's useful that the formula could be edited.

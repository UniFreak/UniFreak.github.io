##**About  Blog's  Index  Rules**

---
###The Motivation
I've just finished the blog theme's moving and rebuild, Next huge project will add some MD files in to fulfill it. So before this, I need to make those rules to organize my blog well, in case of the mass after too much information pilled up.

---

###Basic thought about index
There are only two kind of index way I could use in this blog: the "Gategory" and "tag". It's easy to associate them with vertically and horizontally method. So, I'd like to choose the "Gategory" as a time clue, and the "tag" as key words clue.

####Gategory
I'll fill this part with the time-clue-article. And it will be a clear way to show those little drops.

The format will look like this: "**year_month**"

####Tag
Just as the surface meaning, "tag" will show different aspects of my tech-life.

Some examples follows: "**C_Langues**" "**Axure**" "**Blog**" etc. 

###Advanced suggestions
Maybe I'll offer another way to display this well. And there are still some other advance work remains to be done like to fix up the playing ground or change some pre-plans of this.
But now, I'm enjoying the distribution of Binghua Wang. And just  upload the articles for a while without moving on. on.
